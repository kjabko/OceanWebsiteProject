<h2>What is Overfishing?</h2>
<p class="lead">Overfishing occurs when more fish are caught than are reproduced through natural reproduction. Overfishing has serious consequences. The results not only affect the balance of life in the oceans, but also the social and economic wellbeing of coastal communities who depend on fish for their way of life.

Future Consequences of Continued Overfishing
•	No more fish for human consumption – this could happen in a few decades!
•	Huge increase in jellyfish 
•	Marine ecosystems affected
•	Devastating economic effects on communities
•	Extinction of sea life and sea animals

Causes of Overfishing

Overcapacity
Worldwide, we have way too many fishing fleets. On a global scale we have enough fishing fleet capacity to catch fish from four planets the size of earth.

Commercial Fishing Practices
Fishing methods are having a devastating effect on our marine ecosystems

Bycatch discards
Bycatch occurs as modern fishing techniques cover extensive areas and is and highly unselective. The nets in addition to catching the target fish also catch many other marine animals as well. These are discarded overboard dead or to die. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbrDfh1kL1g


Illegal Fishing
Poor fisheries management in certain countries also contributes to the problem of overfishing. Illegal and pirate fishing vessels often ignore the regulations on quotas, net sizes and permitted fishing areas.

Bottom trawling
Bottom trawling is the process whereby boats drag large nets along the seabed destroying plant life, coal reefs and anything in their path leaving muddy seabeds. These large nets catch young small fish, marine turtles, sharks, seabirds, whales, dolphins and porpoises. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUHcD_jTgVA

Did You Know
•	Over 300,000 whales, dolphins, and porpoises die from entanglement in fishing nets each year

•	Hundreds of thousands of endangered loggerhead turtles and endangered leatherback turtles drown annually on longlines set to catch swordfish and tuna




---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What You Can Do
•	Reduce the amount of fish you eat
•	Choose fish wisely – only buy sustainable fish
•	Buy fish that is caught using sustainable methods
