<p>Viewport width isn’t the only thing media queries can detect. There are a ton of media features we can detect, including color, color index, aspect ratio, device aspect ratio, width, device width, height, device height, orientation, monochrome, resolution, scan, pixel-density and more.

While I don’t even know what a bunch of those are, there are quite a few really helpful features that can helps us out:

Using pixel-density to conditionally serve larger background images and icon sprites for Retina and other hi-res screens.
Using height to detect the available screen height, and adjust styles accordingly. For example, on this site I’m listening for height and scaling my gigantic title type accordingly.</p></div>
