           <h2>Sea level rise</h2><p class="lead">Since the mid-19th century, the sea level has been rising, as a result of human-induced climate change causing thermal expansion of water, the melting of glaciers and ice caps and the loss of ice mass from Greenland and Antarctica.<br>
The 20th century, saw rises in the sea level the sea of about 15-20 centimeters per year. The rate at the end of the century was greater than during the earlier part of the century. Alarmingly Satellite measurements taken over the past decade indicate that the rate has increased has jumped to about 30 centimeters per year.<br>
Continued increases in the sea level will in time have a dramatic impact on many coastal environments. Thousands of Millions of people live in coastal areas that are less than 10 meters above sea level, and two-thirds of the world’s cities have populations over five million located in at-risk areas. With the sea level projected to rise very large numbers of people in vulnerable locations will be forced to relocate.

           <h2>Rising sea temperatures</h2><p class="lead">Scientific research is finding that marine ecosystems are very sensitive to even the most modest temperature change.<br> 
One of the ocean organisms most vulnerable to temperature change is coral. There is evidence that reefs will bleach by ejecting their symbiotic algae at even a slight persistent temperature rise. Bleaching slows coral growth, making coral susceptible to disease leading to large-scale reef die-off. Millions of people around the world depend on the resources coming from coral reefs for their survival, so their disappearance would seriously adversely affect livelihoods.<br>
Krill an important link at the base of the food chain will reproduce in significantly smaller numbers when ocean temperatures rise. This will affect the life cycle of krill eaters, such as penguins and seals—which will in turn causes food shortages for higher predators.<br>
Warmer sea temperatures also facilitate the spread of invasive species and marine diseases. This can lead to forced migrations and even species extinctions.<br>
Some weather experts believe we are currently seeing the effects of higher ocean temperatures in the form of stronger and more frequent tropical storms, hurricanes, and cyclones. Warmer surface water makes it easier for small ocean storms to escalate into larger, more powerful weather systems.

           <h2>Ocean acidification</h2><p class="lead">Each year the oceans absorb a third of human emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) dissolving it in the oceans. Dissolved CO2 creates carbonic acid, which reduces the ocean pH level, making it more acidic<br>
              Ocean acidification will impact marine ecosystems. A decrease in ocean pH lowers the amount of calcium carbonate (the substance created when CO2 is initially dissolved) in the water.  Calcium carbonate is essential for marine organisms such as coral, shellfish, crustaceans, and mollusks to build their shells.<br> 
              If the pH drops by the expected 0.5 during this century, the resulting effect would be a 60% drop in available calcium carbonate. This decrease would put the productivity and even the survival of thousands of marine species at risk.

           <p class="lead">Female turtles come ashore to dig nests in the sand lay their eggs and then return to the sea. The eggs hatch 45-60 day later and the baby turtles are guided t the sea by the moonlight. Rising sea levels are eroding nesting beaches. Temperatures may soon exceed the upper limit for egg incubation which is 34 degrees Celsius. Temperature during incubation determines the sex of the egg. 90 percent of loggerhead turtles currently born in Florida are female owing to high temperatures. If temperatures increase by an additional 1 degree C or more, no males will be produced.
